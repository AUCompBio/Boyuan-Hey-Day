This script is made for celebrating Auburn's annual 'Hey Day'. This is my  second year in Auburn but actually I just know this today. This year's Hey Day will be hosted on Oct 14, I'm so excited that I can join the celebration.
Hey Day can date all the way back to WW II, and AU bodys take together to promote a friendly atmosphere like a family.
